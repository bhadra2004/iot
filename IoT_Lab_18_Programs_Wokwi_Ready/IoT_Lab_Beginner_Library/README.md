# Wokwi-ready IoT Lab Beginner Library

**Start with [WOKWI_SETUP.md](WOKWI_SETUP.md)** for the ESP32 simulator and Python execution steps.

# IoT Lab Beginner Library — Programs 1–18

These are **simplified teaching implementations** based on the uploaded 69-page lab manual, not exact copies. Each numbered folder contains runnable source files and its own README with steps.

## Getting started on Windows
1. Install Python 3.10+ and VS Code. Open this root folder in VS Code.
2. Open Terminal > New Terminal. Run: `py -m venv .venv`
3. Activate with `.venv\Scripts\activate` (PowerShell may require `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass`).
4. Run: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Enter the numbered program folder and follow its README.
6. For Programs 1–4, install Arduino IDE, ESP32 board support and required Arduino libraries (DHT sensor library and PubSubClient).

## Important notes
- Programs 5 and 6 use **local memory** instead of the Supabase cloud database in the manual.
- Programs 8 and 10 use a terminal client instead of a web dashboard; Program 14 uses a plot instead of a dashboard.
- Programs 11–14 require public APIs and internet access; API availability can change.
- Programs 15–17 require you to download datasets yourself from the URLs in their READMEs.
- Program 18 is a simplified browser simulator and optional four-LED ESP32 demo, not the manual's complete twelve-LED circuit.
- Do not commit passwords, API keys, or device tokens to public repositories.
- Public MQTT topics are shared; use a unique topic if you see other people's data.
- Arduino sketches must be opened from the matching `.ino` folder.
