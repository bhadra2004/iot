# Program 18: Smart traffic signal simulation with emergency priority

Simplified learning version based on the supplied IoT lab manual.

## Run
1. Open index.html in your browser and select traffic densities.
2. Click Start to cycle roads; click Emergency to prioritize Road A.
3. Optional: create a Wokwi ESP32 circuit with four green LEDs on GPIO16-19 and a push button on GPIO4, then upload SmartTrafficESP32/SmartTrafficESP32.ino.

This is a teaching prototype. The PDF project specifies a four-road junction with 12 LEDs, resistors and emergency button; the simplified ESP32 demo uses only 4 green LEDs and does not reproduce the full 12-LED hardware design.

### Wokwi simulator
Open the Arduino sketch folder in this program, and copy its `.ino`, `diagram.json` and `libraries.txt` contents into a Wokwi ESP32 project. See the root `WOKWI_SETUP.md`.
